# Food-Wastage-Management-System
The gradual increase in food waste can be seen in recent years. According to WHO 20% of people in the population are struggling for food. The basic concept of this project is to collect the excess/leftover food from donors such as restaurants, marriage halls etc. And distribute to the needy people.
                        This system comprises of two major modules such as donor , needy people. The needy people are from orphanages, old age home. Donor will login through the web page and he/she can enter the food quantity details and address . Directly the details will get populated on the home page of website so that the needy person can contact directly. This project for food redistribution is an enormously successful social innovation that tackles food waste and food poverty. The user details are maintained confidentially.

# PROBLEMS IN EXISTING SYSTEM!
In existing system if anyone is having extra food because of any function , restuarants . Even if they want to give that extra food to any orphanage or poor people they don't have time or don't have an idea about it. 
So that we create a application to donate that extra food to poor people or nearby orphanage.
